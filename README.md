## Introduction

This document explores the process of making a data strategy, and the components of a data strategy. Please note that this does not cover architecture or design and is not limited to any technology type or stack. Instead this is intended to help with forming a strategic approach to data within an enterprise.

## Business Mapping

Before making a data strategy, it is critical to understand what the business does day to day. While this might seem obvious, it can sometimes reveal hidden parts of the business, or it could reveal that alongside the core business there are several other revenue or work streams. A good example of this is the catering industry. It is obvious that caterers provide food and have many staff to do so. It is less obvious that there is usually a large HR department behind the scenes hiring and managing those staff. A retailer obviously sells goods, but it can be less obvious that there may be a huge logistics division behind the scenes, and a health and safety department looking after the safety of the whole process.

The business can be mapped out in various ways including group structure, business unit structure, and business function tracing. When tracing business functions one simply looks at the day to day activities of the business and then maps out the requirements of each of those actions both internal and external. You must also understand the mergers and acquisitions plans of the business along with any potential demergers as these will have significant impact on data strategy.

At the heart of strategy is a plan of action to bring that strategy to fruition. This plan will consist of likely spending and actions as well as principles which should be applied to decisions to bring about the outcomes which are desired. Every business wants to reduce costs and maximise profit, but a strategic principle is designed to override those needs for an improved outcome. A good example of this is when a company wants to become carbon neutral. This will definitely raise costs and reduce profit in the short term, but if the strategy is to become eco-friendly then that is an acceptable trade off. Regulatory compliance requirements must be placed at the very top of the list of principles since these are not optional.

In terms of direct action, we need to understand the methods of data acquisition, processing and presentation. These can then directly map to actions which will either build internal competency centres or discover and crate strong partnerships with companies who have those skills.

### Business Data Sets

During this activity, we identify and classify data assets. These are the sets of data within the organisation and could be sales data, staff data, vehicle data, video or audio assets, photos or pictures, or any other kind of data you can imagine. They will closely map to at least one business activity, either directly or as a supporting function. For instance, you might have a very large fleet of vehicles which has its own data set. Those vehicles all need to be driven and maintained, so you'll also likely have a significant data set about the staff as well, whether they are internal or agency staff. It's also likely you'd have a data set about accidents both in and around the vehicles which would probably be owned by a health and safety department.

It can be useful to understand whether the data is structured or unstructured and how it is likely to be stored and accessed (file share, database, etc.). This can help when considering how data is processed, and how it can be processed to increase value to the organisation. Ease of integration can also be affected, for instance where proprietary formats, or products are used which might make the data hard to access.

Understanding how the data is created is also useful. Much of your business data will likely be entered either by staff, suppliers or customers into some kind of application with a database back end. Do not overlook creative types of data such as photo, video and audio, office documents, and streaming data from other sources. External data from third parties might also play a role in providing your services.

### Identify Opportunities
## Business Priorities
## Define Missions and Principles
 * Mission - transform the business
 what changes are needed to push the business towards it's goals
 * Mission - sustainability
 how can we make this sustainable within the business?

### Principle - Data Value
the value in our data is:
we're in an ecosystem
it's an asset
etc.

## Report

### Data Acquisition

A section detailing the more likely data acquisition methods such as apps, IoT etc.

### Processing

This section details the most likely ways data will be processed in the environment such as within apps as data is created, cloud analytics, or batch.

### Presentation

This section will list the ideal ways data will be used and presented within the business. This could be through reports, APIs, data sharing, or simply through apps to customers or users.
